Creating a README.md file for your Todo App on GitHub is a great way to provide an overview of your project, its features, and how to use it. Here's an example of the content you can include:

# Todo App

This is a simple Todo App implemented using React and Redux. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, deleting, updating, and viewing them. The application also utilizes localStorage to persist the task data, ensuring that the data isn't lost when the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by providing a title, description, and completion status.
- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be deleted individually, removing them from the list.
- **Update Task**: Tasks can be edited to update their title, description, and completion status.
- **View Task**: Users can view the details of each task, including its title, description, and completion status.
- **List of Tasks**: The app displays a list of all tasks, allowing users to easily see their current tasks.
